1) Build: 
	+ Open terminal, change working directory to this directory
	+ Type "make" to build the program, the name of the compiler is "cpslcompiler"
2) Run: 
	+ Run "./cpslcompiler [filename]" to read and compile a cpsl program from file
3) Output:
	+ the output MIPS file is "out.asm"
    + run "java -jar Mars4_5.jar out.asm" to execute the MIPS file   
    + For incorrect cpsl programs (syntactic and/or semantic), the compiler will print error messages. You should ignore the file "out.asm" file in these cases.
4) Test programs:
	+ I have run and tested all cpsl programs in the "TestFiles" and "MyTestFiles"
	+ "TestFiles" contains all cpsl programs in CS6300 GitHub repository 
	+ "MyTestFiles" contains all cpsl programs I have written to test in previous assignments
    + All programs executed correctly [I tested against results in "Base" folder]
    + There are some mistakes with the test files:
    	+ array_ret.cpsl: There is function overloading on file, I do not implement function overloading, I print an error when compiling.
    	+ func_types.cpsl: In line 16, the CHR is applied to BOOLEAN value, I print an error when compiling. My result still matched against in "Base" folder
    	+ mix_expressions.cpsl: I define not of an integer is 0 if it not equal to zero, not of zero is 1. Thus ~-5=0 and ~5=0.
