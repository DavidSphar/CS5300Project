1) Build: 
	+ Open terminal, change working directory to this directory
	+ Type "make" to build the program, the name of the compiler is "cpslcompiler"
2) Run: 
	+ Run "./cpslcompiler [filename]" to read and compile a cpsl program from file
3) Output:
	+ the output MIPS file is "out.asm"
    + run "java -jar Mars4_5.jar out.asm" to execute the MIPS file   
    + For incorrect cpsl programs (syntactic and/or semantic), the compiler will print error messages. You should ignore the file "out.asm" file in these cases.
4) Test programs:
	+ I have run and tested all cpsl programs in the "TestFiles", "TestFiles2", "TestFunc" folders
	+ "TestFiles" contains all cpsl programs in class GitHub repository (I removed all programes that have Array and Record)
	+ "TestFiles2" contains all cpsl programs I have written to test in previous assignments
	+ "TestFunc" contains all cpsl programs I have written to test functions
    + All programs executed correctly
